    "In this section we want to simulate the ML (maximum likelihood) rule for independent observations.  For simplicity, we consider two hyptheses for a sequence of $N$ independent discrete random variables, with values in {0, . . . , n-1}.  Let $p_0$ and $p_1$ be two probability vectors of length $n$, representing two probability distributions over the set of possible values {0,1, . . . ,n-1}.  Under hypothesis $H_1$ the observations are independent with pmf $p_1$ and under $H_0$ the observations are independent with pmf $p_0.$  The given code is for $p_0=[0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2]$ and $p_1=[0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your ECE 313 class, you have used the likelihood ratio test (LRT) implementation of the ML rule to determine which hypothesis is most likely. Recall that the liklihood ratio for each observation $k$ is defined by: $$\\Lambda(k) = \\frac{p_1(k)}{p_0(k)}$$   For a single observaton $k$, under the ML rule, we declare Hypothesis 1 if $\\Lambda(k)>1$ and declare Hypothesis 0 if $\\Lambda(k)<1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we want to be able to declare a hypothesis based on multiple observations. We can still use the LRT to determine which hypothesis to declare. This requires simply multiplying the likelihood ratios for the individual observations, to yield the likelihood ratio for all of the observations:\n",
    "$$\\Lambda(k_0,k_1,...k_{N-1})=\\frac{p_1(k_0)}{p_0(k_0)}*\\frac{p_1(k_1)}{p_0(k_1)}*...\\frac{p_1(k_{N-1})}{p_0(k_{N-1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below creates two distributions (one for each hypothesis). It randomly chooses a hypothesis to be true and generates N random variates from that distribution. Finally, it computes $\\Lambda$ and compares it to the threshold  one to declare (i.e. detect) a hypothesis.  Afterwards it evaluates whether an error, either a false alarm or miss, occurred.  Run the code a few times to see different outcomes."

    "If we take a look at the values of the likelihood ratio produced by the simulations above for $N>1$, we see that sometimes the value is much larger than one or much smaller than one.  This suggests that even if we used fewer than all N observations we would have made the correct decision.   Other times the value of the likelihood ratio is close to one, suggesting it would be useful to take some additional observations.    The  idea of *sequential hypothesis testing* (originally developed by A. Wald in the 1940's--see his 1945 paper <A href=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2235829> \"Sequential tests of statistical hypotheses\"</A>) is to try to reduce the average number of observations required for the same error probabilities by using a variable number of observations.   Specifically, Wald's *sequential probability ratio test* (SPRT) works as follows. After each observation we compare the likelihood ratio obtained so far to two thresholds, A and B, where  0 < B < 1 < A.  If the likelihood ratio is smaller than B we stop taking samples and declare $H_0$ to be true.   If the likelihood ratio is larger than A we stop taking samples and declare $H_1$ to be true.   If the likelihood ratio is between the thresholds we take another observation. Below is an example of sequential hypothesis testing for the two hypotheses we had in the previous problem."

Instead of multiplying likelihood ratios as we did above, we can add log likelihood ratios using the update rule $S_i = S_{i-1}+\\log(\\Lambda_i).$  If we stop taking observations when $S_i<\\log(B)$ or $S_i>\\log(A)$ the test is equivalent to the one without taking logs and using thresholds B and A.\n",

That way, you should obtain a sequential testing rule with error probabilities of each type smaller than those for the nonsquential method in Problem 1.\n",

    "__Answer 3:__<br>We can find that the part two of this problem gives the smallest number of observations needed (about 1.5 steps) to get a smaller error probability (about 0.17). The part one of this problem gives the second smallest number of observations needed (about 4 steps) to get a second smaller error probability (about 0.21). The last part of problem 1 defines 25 observations during each simulation and gives a rather large error probability (about 0.5)"

    "A very popular problem in random walks is known as the gambler's ruin problem. You should recognize this as a more simplified version of that zombie simulation we did back in Lab 6. Suppose that you're a gambler and you have $k$ units of money. You think you're a pretty good gambler and tell yourself you will leave the casino as soon as you have accumulated a total of $b$ units money, for some $b$ with $b>k$.\n",
    "However, if you run out of money you need to stop playing; we say you are ruined in that case.  You can place only one bet for one unit of money at a time and the outcomes of the bet's are independent of each other. With each bet you have a probability $p$ of increasing your total by one and a probability $1-p$ of decreasing your total by one.  You could do this, for example, by betting one unit of money on red at a\n",
    "<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette> US roulette wheel </a> (which has 18 red numbers, 18 black numbers, and two dark green numbers 0 and 00), $p=18/38.$   What's the probability you ruin yourself (have no money left) before walking out of the casino? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question of probability requires a recurrence equation and we'll get to that in a little bit, but first let's just simulate this problem. It is essentially a random walk. We can create a discrete random variable object to store the distribution used for the outcome of each bet, and use random variates of the object to model the independent outcomes.  We stop our simulation when we've either lost all our money or reached our goal."

    "Explore the gambler's ruin simulator if you want. For the given numbers ($p=18/38,b=20,$ initial stake 15) do you think the chance of success is greater than 50%?  Change the probabilities or the monetary values. What would you expect to happen if we had $p=\\frac{1}{2}$? As stated before, in order to determine the probability of ruin, we need to set up a recurrence equation. Remember that the outcome for each bet placed is independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $r_k$ represent the probability of ruin when we start with k units of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bets are independent we should see, by the law of total probability based on the outcome of the first bet, that $r_k=p*r_{k+1}+(1-p)*r_{k-1}.$   That is, the probability that we're ruined starting with $k$ units of money is equal to $p$ times the probability we're ruined starting with $k+1$ units of money plus $1-p$ times the probability we're ruined starting with $k-1$ units of money.  The boundary conditions are $r_0=1$ and $r_b=0,$ becasue if we have no money the probability we're ruined is 1, if we're at our goal, the probability we're ruined is 0). So we have $b-1$ equations for $b-1$ unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen such a set of linear equations in one of your math classes, but this recurrence has a closed form solution: $r_k=C_1\\lambda_1^k+C_2\\lambda_2^k$, where $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ solve the characteristic equation $\\lambda=p\\lambda^2+(1-p)$ which is derived from our recurrence equation. (A quick way to derive this characteristic equation from the recurrence equation is to replace $r_k$ with $\\lambda^k$, $r_{k+1}$ with $\\lambda^{k+1}$ and $r_{k-1}$ with $\\lambda^{k-1}$, then cancel out $\\lambda^{k-1}$ on both sides). To solve for the two constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we use the two boundary conditions $r_0=1, r_b=0.$  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example let's use the initial conditions set up above where $b=20,k=15,p=\\frac{18}{38}$. The first step is to find $\\lambda$ from the recurrence equation: $0=p\\lambda^2-\\lambda+(1-p)$"

    "<br>**<SPAN style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #C0C0C0\">Problem 4:</SPAN>** Now, I want you to analyze a slightly more complex version of the gambler's ruin problem. Suppose that a gambler walks into a casino with 15 units of money and will leave if he meets his goal of 20 units of money or if he loses all of his money. For each bet, there is a probability of 0.4 that he wins one unit of money, a probability 0.15 that he breaks even (neither wins nor loses money), and a probability 0.45 that he loses one unit of money. \n",

It will be of the form $r_k = p_1r_{k+1} + p_2r_k+p_3r_{k-1}$, which has a closed form solution: $r_k=C_1\\lambda_1^k+C_2\\lambda_2^k$.
